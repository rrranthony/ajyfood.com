# Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies

## Ingredients
- 1 egg
- 1/2 C unsalted butter
- 1/2 C brown sugar
- 1/4 C coconut sugar
- 1 T vanilla extract
- 1 C rolled oats
- 1 C whole wheat flour
- 1/2 C unsweetened shredded coconut
- 1/2 t baking soda
- 1/4 t salt
- 1 C semi-sweet chocolate chips (optional: substitute Reese's minis unwrapped)

## Steps
1. To a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment add the egg, butter, brown sugar, coconut sugar, and vanilla extract. Beat on medium-high speed until creamed and well combined, about 4 minutes.
2. Add the oats, flour, coconut, baking soda, and salt to the mixer. Beat on low speed until just combined, about 1 minute.
3. Add the chocolate chips and beat on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds.
4. Using a 1/4-cup measure or your hands, form approximately 12 mounds of dough, roll into balls, flatten slightly, and place on a large plate or tray.
5. Cover the tray with dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (and up to 5 days), which will prevent the dough from baking into thinner and flatter cookies.
6. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
7. Place dough mounds on the lined baking sheet and bake for 11-13 minutes.
