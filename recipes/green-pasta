<h1>Green Pasta</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 8-ounce block Parmigiano Reggiano (preferred over Parmesan), cut into chunks after removing the rind (save the rind for a soup)</li>
<li>20 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
<li>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>1 bunch curly kale, de-ribbed (about 6 ounces once de-ribbed)</li>
<li>10 ounces baby spinach</li>
<li>1 pound bucatini (or your favorite pasta)</li>
<li>1 lemon, zested and juiced</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Blend the chunks of Parmigiano Reggiano until finely grated. Leave in the blender.</li>
<li>In a small pot, cook garlic and olive oil over low heat until the garlic is light golden-brown and softened, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (2 tablespoons kosher salt). Add kale and cook 2 minutes. Keeping kale in the pot, add spinach and cook 3 minutes more, until wilted. Remove from heat.</li>
<li>Do not drain the pot. Use tongs to transfer greens to the blender, letting excess water drain off. Do not drain the pot. Bring the water back to a boil for the pasta.</li>
<li>Cook pasta according to package directions. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain pasta and return it to the pot.</li>
<li>Add cooked garlic and oil to the blender with the Parmigiano Reggiano, lemon zest and juice, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Blend until smooth, adding a bit of reserved pasta water if needed for a saucy consistency.</li>
<li>Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt or lemon juice if needed.</li>
<li>Add 1 cup of sauce to the pasta and toss to coat. Add more sauce as desired until well coated (about 1 1/2 cups total). You will likely have extra sauce.</li>
<li>Divide among bowls and serve.</li>
