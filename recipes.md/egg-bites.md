# Egg Bites

## Ingredients
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 cup minced broccoli
- 4 eggs
- 1 cup cottage cheese (drained if needed)
- 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Steps
1. Preheat the oven to 350 F and grease a 24 mini muffin cup pan with nonstick spray very well.
2. Mix all ingredients together in a medium bowl until well combined.
3. Spoon into muffin cups, filling about to the brim.
4. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes or until firm to the touch and golden brown around the edges.
5. Let cool for about 5 minutes in the pan before serving to allow them to firm up a bit. Use a paring knife around the edges to help remove them if needed. Serve warm or at room temperature.
