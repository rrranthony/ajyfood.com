<h1>Tofu Scramble</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
<li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
<li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
<li>2 medium tomatoes, diced, with juices</li>
<li>1/3 cup oil-packed unsalted sun-dried tomatoes, drained and chopped</li>
<li>4 mushrooms (white or brown), diced</li>
<li>1 cup kale, stems removed, chopped</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
<li>1 tablespoon nutritional yeast</li>
<li>1 14-ounce package firm or extra-firm tofu, drained and pressed</li>
<li>2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice</li>
<li>2 teaspoons salt, to taste</li>
<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and sauté for 4 to 5 minutes. If the pan looks dry or onions or garlic begin to stick, add a splash of water or vegetable broth (1 to 2 tablespoons at a time) and stir until absorbed. Continue for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onion is softened.</li>
<li>Add the diced bell pepper, mushrooms, and tomatoes (with juices). Raise the heat to medium-high and sauté for another 5 minutes, until the vegetables start to soften.</li>
<li>Stir in the sun-dried tomatoes, turmeric, and cumin. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes to toast the spices.</li>
<li>Crumble the tofu into 1/2-inch pieces directly into the skillet. Stir until evenly mixed and the tofu is coated with the spices. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until heated through.</li>
<li>Add the kale and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, just until wilted.</li>
<li>Stir in the nutritional yeast, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper. Adjust seasoning to taste. Serve hot.</li>
