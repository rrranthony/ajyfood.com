# Zucchini Cheesy Egg Bites

## Ingredients
- 1 medium zucchini
- 5 large eggs
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder

## Steps
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat an 8x8-inch pan with nonstick cooking spray and line with parchment paper.
- Cut the stems off the zucchini. Grate using a box grater or food processor. Place in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Measure 1 cup tightly packed grated zucchini.
- In a medium bowl, combine the zucchini with the remaining ingredients. Stir well to make a uniform batter. Pour into the prepared pan.
- Bake for 25â€“30 minutes, until the edges are lightly golden and the top is firm and set.
- Remove from the oven, let cool, then remove from the pan and slice into sticks or squares.
