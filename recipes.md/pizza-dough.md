# Pizza Dough

## Ingredients
- 22.5 oz bread flour
- 0.5 oz sugar
- 0.35 oz kosher salt
- 0.35 oz instant yeast
- 1.125 oz olive oil
- 15 oz lukewarm water

## Steps
1. Place flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in the food processor.
2. Pulse 3 to 4 times until combined.
3. Add olive oil and water to food processor.
4. Run food processor until mixture forms a ball that rides around the bowl above the blade, about 15 seconds.
5. Continue processing 15 seconds longer.
6. Remove dough from food processor and, using a food scale, divide dough into three equal parts and shape into balls.
7. At least 2 hours before baking (or longer if dough was in the refrigerator) place dough ball in a medium bowl, drizzle with a few drops of olive oil, use your hands to roll and cover the ball in the olive oil, then cover with plastic wrap. Dough will rise and be ready for spreading out into pizza dough for topping.
8. If freezing, for each dough ball, place a 12-inch length of plastic wrap on the counter, place the dough ball on top, and fold the plastic wrap around the ball. Place plastic-wrapped dough ball into a 1-quart freezer bag and into freezer.
9. When using frozen dough, place frozen dough ball in the refrigerator the day before baking, then on the day of baking, follow Step 7 above.
