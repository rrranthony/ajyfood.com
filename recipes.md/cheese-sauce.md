# Cheese Sauce

## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 C russet potatoes (about 1 medium), finely diced
- 1/4 C red bell pepper, finely diced
- 1/2 small yellow onion, diced
- 2 T pine nuts
- 2 T tahini
- 1 T lemon juice
- 2 T nutritional yeast
- 2 T arrowroot powder
- 1 t salt

## Steps
1. Combine the potato, bell pepper, onion, and pine nuts in a small saucepan and cover with water.
2. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium and cook until the potatoes are very tender, about 10 minutes.
3. Drain, reserving 3/4 C of the cooking water.
4. Combine the drained potato mixture, reserved cooking water, tahini, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, arrowroot powder, and salt in a high powered blender.
5. Blend on high until everything is smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes (the starch in the potatoes needs to break down).
