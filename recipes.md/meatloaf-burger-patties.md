# Meatloaf Burger Patties

## Ingredients
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1/3 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 1/4 cup milk
- 1 egg
- 1/4 cup finely grated onion (with juices)
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon ketchup
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

## Steps
1. In a large bowl, mix the panko with the milk and let it soak for 5 minutes. This helps keep the patties extra tender.
2. Add the egg, grated onion, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the bowl. Stir well.
3. Gently mix in the ground beef until just combined. Try not to overmix, as that can make the patties tough.
4. Form into 8 small patties, about 2 inches in diameter.
5. Cook the patties in a lightly oiled pan over medium heat, about 3-4 minutes per side. Alternatively, bake on a parchment-lined baking sheet at 375Â°F for 15-18 minutes.
6. Serve on mini slider buns and add your favorite toppings.
