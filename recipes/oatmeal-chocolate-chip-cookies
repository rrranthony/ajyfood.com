<h1>Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>1/2 C unsalted butter</li>
  <li>1/2 C brown sugar</li>
  <li>1/4 C coconut sugar</li>
  <li>1 T vanilla extract</li>
  <li>1 C rolled oats</li>
  <li>1 C whole wheat flour</li>
  <li>1/2 C unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
  <li>1/2 t baking soda</li>
  <li>1/4 t salt</li>
  <li>1 C semi-sweet chocolate chips (optional: substitute Reese's minis unwrapped)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>To a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment add the egg, butter, brown sugar, coconut sugar, and vanilla extract. Beat on medium-high speed until creamed and well combined, about 4 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add the oats, flour, coconut, baking soda, and salt to the mixer. Beat on low speed until just combined, about 1 minute.</li>
  <li>Add the chocolate chips and beat on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds.</li>
  <li>Using a 1/4-cup measure or your hands, form approximately 12 mounds of dough, roll into balls, flatten slightly, and place on a large plate or tray.</li>
  <li>Cover the tray with dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (and up to 5 days), which will prevent the dough from baking into thinner and flatter cookies.</li>
  <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
  <li>Place dough mounds on the lined baking sheet and bake for 11-13 minutes.</li>
