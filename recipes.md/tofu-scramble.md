# Tofu Scramble

## Ingredients
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 2 medium tomatoes, diced, with juices
- 1/3 cup oil-packed unsalted sun-dried tomatoes, drained and chopped
- 4 mushrooms (white or brown), diced
- 1 cup kale, stems removed, chopped
- 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
- 1 14-ounce package firm or extra-firm tofu, drained and pressed
- 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Steps
1. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and sauté for 4 to 5 minutes. If the pan looks dry or onions or garlic begin to stick, add a splash of water or vegetable broth (1 to 2 tablespoons at a time) and stir until absorbed. Continue for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onion is softened.
2. Add the diced bell pepper, mushrooms, and tomatoes (with juices). Raise the heat to medium-high and sauté for another 5 minutes, until the vegetables start to soften.
3. Stir in the sun-dried tomatoes, turmeric, and cumin. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes to toast the spices.
4. Crumble the tofu into 1/2-inch pieces directly into the skillet. Stir until evenly mixed and the tofu is coated with the spices. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until heated through.
5. Add the kale and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, just until wilted.
6. Stir in the nutritional yeast, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper. Adjust seasoning to taste. Serve hot.
