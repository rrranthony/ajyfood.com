# Cinnamon Rolls

## Ingredients
- 2 t active dry yeast
- 1/2 C lukewarm water
- 1 C unsalted butter
- 2/3 C sugar
- 1 C whole milk
- 1 1/2 t salt
- 2 T vanilla extract
- 4 eggs
- 7 C bread flour
- 2 T canola oil

## Steps
1. In a small bowl add the lukewarm water and the active dry yeast.
2. In a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, cream the butter and sugar together for 7 minutes.
3. To the creamed butter and sugar add in the yeast and water mixture, whole milk, salt, vanilla extract, eggs, and 5 1/2 C bread flour.
4. Continue to run the mixture for a few more minutes, adding the remaining bread flour 1/4 C at a time until the dough is thick but not sticky, and forms a ball at the bottom of the mixer. You may not need all 7 cups of flour.
5. Reduce the speed to low and let the mixer knead the dough for 15 minutes.
6. Use the canola oil to lightly coat a large metal bowl (it should be large enough for the dough to double in size).
7. Transfer the dough to the oiled bowl, rolling the dough around so the outside of the dough is lightly covered with oil.
8. Cover the bowl with foil and let the dough rise in a warm, draft free spot for an hour and a half. The dough should nearly double in size.
9. While you wait, prepare the filling and icing and line a baking sheet with parchment paper and brush with some of the melted butter.
