# Butternut Squash and Lentil Soup

## Ingredients
- 1 small butternut squash, cut in half lengthwise, seeds scooped out    
- 5 cloves garlic, chopped  
- 3 medium carrots, chopped  
- 2 stalks celery, chopped  
- 1 medium white onion, chopped  
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin (or Herbes de Provence)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 6 cups vegetable stock  
- 1 cup dried red lentils  

### Yogurt sauce:
- 1 cup plain Greek yogurt  
- 3/4 teaspoon smoked paprika  
- 2 tablespoons olive oil  
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Steps
1. Preheat oven to 420 degrees F.  
2. Place butternut squash halves cut-side down on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Roast until soft and browned on edges, about 45 minutes. Let cool slightly, then scoop out the flesh and set aside.  
3. In a 6-quart saucepan over medium heat, add garlic, carrots, celery, and onion with a splash of water or broth. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 12 to 14 minutes. Add more water if needed to prevent sticking.  
4. Stir in cumin (or Herbes de Provence), squash, salt, and pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes.  
5. Add stock and lentils. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer slightly covered until lentils are very tender, about 20 minutes.  
6. When the soup has cooled slightly, pur√©e with an immersion blender or countertop blender until smooth.  
7. Stir paprika and 2 tablespoons of olive oil into yogurt to make the sauce.  
8. Ladle soup into bowls. Add a generous dollop of yogurt sauce and swirl in. Sprinkle with paprika to garnish.
