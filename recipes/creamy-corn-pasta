<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 pound farfalle</li>
<li>1 large shallot, diced</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
<li>2 (16-ounce) bags frozen white corn (yellow is okay)</li>
<li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>1/2 cup water</li>
<li>2 lemons</li>
<li>2/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

<li>Transfer the mixture to a blender. Add Parmesan, juice of 1 lemon, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Blend until smooth.</li>
