<h3>Dough</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 t active dry yeast</li>
  <li>1/2 C lukewarm water</li>
  <li>1 C unsalted butter</li>
  <li>2/3 C sugar</li>
  <li>1 C whole milk</li>
  <li>1 1/2 t salt</li>
  <li>2 T vanilla extract</li>
  <li>4 eggs</li>
  <li>7 C bread flour</li>
  <li>2 T canola oil</li>
</ul>

<h3>Filling</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 C sugar</li>
  <li>1/2 C brown sugar, packed</li>
  <li>4 T cinnamon</li>
  <li>3/4 C unsalted butter, melted</li>
</ul>

<h3>Icing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1/2 C unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
  <li>8 oz cream cheese</li>
  <li>2 T vanilla extract</li>
  <li>1 t cinnamon</li>
  <li>1 lb powdered sugar</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<h3>Dough</h3>
<ol>
  <li>In a small bowl add the lukewarm water and the active dry yeast.</li>
  <li>In a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, cream the butter and sugar together for 7 minutes.</li>
  <li>To the creamed butter and sugar add in the yeast and water mixture, whole milk, salt, vanilla extract, eggs, and 5 1/2 C bread flour.</li>
  <li>Continue to run the mixture for a few more minutes, adding the remaining bread flour 1/4 C at a time until the dough is thick but not sticky, and forms a ball at the bottom of the mixer. You may not need all 7 cups of flour.</li>
  <li>Reduce the speed to low and let the mixer knead the dough for 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Use the canola oil to lightly coat a large metal bowl (it should be large enough for the dough to double in size).</li>
  <li>Transfer the dough to the oiled bowl, rolling the dough around so the outside of the dough is lightly covered with oil.</li>
  <li>Cover the bowl with foil and let the dough rise in a warm, draft free spot for an hour and a half. The dough should nearly double in size.</li>
  <li>While you wait, prepare the filling and icing and line a baking sheet with parchment paper and brush with some of the melted butter.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Filling</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Stir together the sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon.</li>
  <li>Keep the melted butter to the side for use with the dough.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Icing</h3>

<ol>
  <li>In the stand mixer fitted with a flat beater, mix the butter, cream cheese, vanilla extract, and cinnamon until smooth.</li>
  <li>Gradually add the powdered sugar and beat an additional 3 minutes until light and fluffy.</li>
  <li>Transfer icing to a jar.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Rolls</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Once the dough has risen, roll the dough into a 12x18-inch rectangle, with the long side of the rectangle next to you.</li>
  <li>Brush the butter on all but a 1/2-inch strip along the 18-inch side of the dough that is furthest from you. This will allow the dough to stick to itself when you roll it up.</li>
  <li>Generously sprinkle the cinnamon sugar filling over the butter.</li>
  <li>Cut 1-inch by 12-inch strips of dough.</li>
  <li>Roll up each strip of dough snug but not too tight, and arrange on the baking sheet.</li>
  <li>Brush the tops and sides of the rolls with the remaining melted butter.</li>
  <li>Cover the baking sheet with foil and let the rolls rise overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
  <li>Remove the baking sheet from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking.</li>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
  <li>Bake rolls for 20-25 minutes until puffy and golden brown.</li>
  <li>Allow the rolls to cool for 10 minutes before topping with icing.</li>
</ol>
