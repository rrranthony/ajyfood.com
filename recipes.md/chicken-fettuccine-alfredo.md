# Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo

## Ingredients
- 1 pound fettuccine
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 pound chicken breast
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (for chicken)
- 1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese (for sauce)
- 4 tablespoons salted butter
- 3 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 1 cup heavy cream

## Steps
1. Cook the fettuccine in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain.  
2. In a bowl, toss the chicken with olive oil, 2 tablespoons Parmesan, and black pepper.  
3. Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a large pan over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken until golden and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Turn off the heat, add lemon juice, and transfer the chicken to a plate.  
4. In the same pan, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Stir in the chicken broth and heavy cream, whisking until smooth. Simmer for 5 minutes to thicken.  
5. Stir in 1 1/2 cups Parmesan and the cooked fettuccine. Toss to coat and cook for 2 more minutes.  
6. Remove from heat. Slice the chicken and serve on top of the pasta.
