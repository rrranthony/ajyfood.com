# Kale Pizza

## Ingredients
- 1 8-oz pizza dough ball
- Bread flour for dusting dough
- 4 oz (1 quart) kale leaves, roughly chopped
- Olive oil
- Salt and pepper
- 3 oz Gruyère cheese, grated (Fontina or Jack are okay)
- 4 oz fresh mozzarella cheese, torn into small chunks
- 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- Red pepper flakes (optional)

## Steps
1. Place ball of dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour.
2. Adjust oven rack to top position and place a pizza stone on top. Preheat oven to maximum heat setting.
3. Add kale to a large bowl and drizzle lightly with olive oil (start with less oil than you think you need).
4. Season kale with salt and pepper.
5. Toss and massage kale until evenly coated with oil. If more oil is needed to coat the kale, drizzle a little more oil and toss and massage again.
6. When ready to bake, dust dough and pizza peel with bread flour and stretch dough out to fill the pizza peel.
7. Sprinkle garlic over the dough, followed by Gruyère and mozzarella, and red pepper flakes if using.
8. Transfer pizza to pizza stone. Set timer to 1 minute.
9. After 1 minute rotate pizza and bake for an additional 30 seconds to 1 minute (or longer if needed), watching closely to make sure pizza only barely starts to brown. Remove pizza from oven, keeping it on the pizza peel.
10. Turn broiler to high.
11. Dump kale onto the pizza then press down and spread kale out with hands to ensure kale is spread out evenly to the edges.
12. Transfer pizza to pizza stone.
13. Check pizza every 30 seconds. Remove pizza from oven once kale is charred and crisp and edges of pizza are browned, about 2 minutes total.
