# Salty Thin and Crispy Oatmeal Cookies

## Ingredients
- 1 cup flour
- 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 14 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 1/2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
- 1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt

## Steps
1. Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and heat oven to 350Â°F.
2. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. In a separate bowl, cream the butter and both sugars.
4. Mix in egg and vanilla extract.
5. Combine flour mixture and butter and sugar mixture, then mix in oats until well incorporated.
6. Portion out 2 tablespoons per cookie, roll between palms into balls and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper about 2 1/2 inches apart.
7. Press each dough ball down to roughly 3/4-inch thickness.
8. Lightly sprinkle sea salt evenly over flattened dough balls before baking.
9. Bake 1 sheet at a time for 13 to 16 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through, until cookies are a deep golden brown, edges are crisp, and centers yield to slight pressure when pressed.
10. Cool cookies completely on the baking sheet.

Makes 24 cookies.
