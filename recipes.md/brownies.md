# Brownies

## Ingredients
- 3 tablespoons flaxseed meal
- 1 cup walnuts
- 1 1/4 cups maple syrup
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 4 oz unsweetened baking chocolate
- 2 tablespoons cocoa powder
- 1 cup oat flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- Pinch of salt

## Steps
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Line an 8x8-inch baking dish with parchment paper.
3. In a small bowl, mix the flaxseed meal with 1/4 cup water. Let it sit until it is egg-like in texture, about 5 minutes.
4. In a food processor, blend the walnuts with 3 tablespoons of water. Blend until the mixture turns whitish and forms a hummus-like textured clump.
5. To the walnut mixture, add the flaxseed meal mixture, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Blend until smooth.
6. Melt the baking chocolate in the microwave (use low power).
7. Add the melted chocolate and cocoa powder to the mixture in the food processor and blend until smooth.
8. In a large bowl, combine oat flour, baking soda, and salt.
9. Add the flour mixture to the mixture in the food processor and blend until combined.
10. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. There will be about 1 cup of extra batter that can be baked separately (in a ramekin) or eaten as is.
11. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes.
