# Green Puffs

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup rolled oats
- 2 tablespoons flaxseed meal
- 1 1/2 cups spinach
- 1 banana
- 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 cup raisins

## Steps
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
3. Place oats in a blender and blend into a fine meal.
4. Add flaxseed meal to a small bowl and mix with 3 tablespoons water to make a paste. Add more water if needed.
5. Add flaxseed paste and all remaining ingredients to blender.
6. Blend until well combined. Consistency should be similar to pancake batter.
7. Scoop spoonfuls (about 2 tablespoons each) onto parchment-lined baking sheet. You should end up with 16-20 dollops.
8. Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees F, lower heat to 250 degrees F and bake for another 15 minutes.
9. Puffs will still be a little soft when you take them out, but will firm up a little bit when they cool.
