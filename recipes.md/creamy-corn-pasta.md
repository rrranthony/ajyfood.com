# Creamy Corn Pasta

## Ingredients
- 1 pound farfalle
- 1 large shallot, diced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 (16-ounce) bags frozen white corn (yellow is okay)
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup water
- 2 lemons
- 2/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon dried basil (or 1/2 bunch fresh, thinly sliced)

## Steps
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta until al dente according to package instructions.
2. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water using a mug or measuring cup. Drain the pasta.
3. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter.
4. Add the shallot and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, for 3 to 5 minutes until shallot is translucent.
5. Add frozen corn and 1/2 cup water. Cook over medium-high heat for 5 to 6 minutes, until corn is tender.
6. Transfer the mixture to a blender. Add Parmesan, juice of 1 lemon, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Blend until smooth.
7. Add reserved pasta water as needed to make the sauce pourable and smooth. Taste and adjust with more lemon, salt, or a pinch of sugar if needed.
8. Return pasta to the pot. Pour in the corn sauce and stir in basil. Toss to combine, adding more pasta water if needed.
10. Adjust seasoning with additional lemon juice or salt to taste.
11. Serve in bowls. Garnish with extra Parmesan if desired.
