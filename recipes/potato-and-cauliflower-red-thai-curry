<h1>Potato and Cauliflower Red Thai Curry</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 (14-ounce) can coconut milk</li>
<li>1 (14-ounce) can diced tomatoes, with their juices</li>
<li>1/2 small head cauliflower, cut into 1/2-inch florets (2 cups)</li>
<li>2 large yellow potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes (2 cups)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons red curry paste (Thai Kitchen brand works)</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>3/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
<li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
<li>1/2 cup dried red lentils</li>
<li>3 cups spinach, chopped</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>In an Instant Pot, stir together the coconut milk, diced tomatoes with their juices, cauliflower, potato, red curry paste, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper until well combined.</li>
<li>Add the red lentils on top of the mixture and gently press the lentils into the liquid (do not stir the lentils into the mixture, as this can result in burning). There will just be enough liquid to cover most of the veggies, but this is normal.</li>
<li>Secure lid in the lock position and check that the steam release handle is pointing to the "Sealing" position.</li>
<li>Set Pressure Cook to High for 5 minutes and begin cooking.</li>
<li>Once pressure cooking is complete, immediately do a quick pressure release to avoid overcooking the curry.</li>
<li>Carefully open the lid and stir in the spinach. Allow it to wilt, uncovered, for a couple of minutes. Press "Cancel" to turn the heat off.</li>
<li>Serve over rice, with naan, and any other desired garnishes.</li>
