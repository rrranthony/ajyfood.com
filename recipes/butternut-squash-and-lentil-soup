<h1>Butternut Squash and Lentil Soup</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 small butternut squash, cut in half lengthwise, seeds scooped out    </li>
<li>5 cloves garlic, chopped  </li>
<li>3 medium carrots, chopped  </li>
<li>2 stalks celery, chopped  </li>
<li>1 medium white onion, chopped  </li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin (or Herbes de Provence)</li>
<li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
<li>6 cups vegetable stock  </li>
<li>1 cup dried red lentils  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Yogurt sauce:</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 cup plain Greek yogurt  </li>
<li>3/4 teaspoon smoked paprika  </li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil  </li>
<li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 420 degrees F.  </li>
<li>Place butternut squash halves cut-side down on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Roast until soft and browned on edges, about 45 minutes. Let cool slightly, then scoop out the flesh and set aside.  </li>
<li>In a 6-quart saucepan over medium heat, add garlic, carrots, celery, and onion with a splash of water or broth. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 12 to 14 minutes. Add more water if needed to prevent sticking.  </li>
<li>Stir in cumin (or Herbes de Provence), squash, salt, and pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes.  </li>
<li>Add stock and lentils. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer slightly covered until lentils are very tender, about 20 minutes.  </li>
<li>When the soup has cooled slightly, pur√©e with an immersion blender or countertop blender until smooth.  </li>
<li>Stir paprika and 2 tablespoons of olive oil into yogurt to make the sauce.  </li>
<li>Ladle soup into bowls. Add a generous dollop of yogurt sauce and swirl in. Sprinkle with paprika to garnish.</li>
