# Green Pasta

## Ingredients
- 1 8-ounce block Parmigiano Reggiano (preferred over Parmesan), cut into chunks after removing the rind (save the rind for a soup)
- 20 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped
- 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 bunch curly kale, de-ribbed (about 6 ounces once de-ribbed)
- 10 ounces baby spinach
- 1 pound bucatini (or your favorite pasta)
- 1 lemon, zested and juiced

## Steps
1. Blend the chunks of Parmigiano Reggiano until finely grated. Leave in the blender.
2. In a small pot, cook garlic and olive oil over low heat until the garlic is light golden-brown and softened, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
3. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (2 tablespoons kosher salt). Add kale and cook 2 minutes. Keeping kale in the pot, add spinach and cook 3 minutes more, until wilted. Remove from heat.
4. Do not drain the pot. Use tongs to transfer greens to the blender, letting excess water drain off. Do not drain the pot. Bring the water back to a boil for the pasta.
5. Cook pasta according to package directions. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain pasta and return it to the pot.
6. Add cooked garlic and oil to the blender with the Parmigiano Reggiano, lemon zest and juice, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Blend until smooth, adding a bit of reserved pasta water if needed for a saucy consistency.
7. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt or lemon juice if needed.
8. Add 1 cup of sauce to the pasta and toss to coat. Add more sauce as desired until well coated (about 1 1/2 cups total). You will likely have extra sauce.
9. Divide among bowls and serve.
