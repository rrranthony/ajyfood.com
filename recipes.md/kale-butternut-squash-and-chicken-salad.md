## Ingredients
### Dressing
- 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 1/2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- A few grinds of black pepper

### Salad
- 1 large red onion, sliced lengthwise 1/4-inch thick
- 1 pound butternut squash, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 bunch curly kale, de-ribbed and chopped
- 1 large Honeycrisp apple, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup dried cranberries (or 3 pitted Medjool dates, chopped)
- 1/2 cup roasted pecans (or candied pecans)
- 8 ounces feta, crumbled

## Steps
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
2. Make the dressing: Combine balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, maple syrup, Dijon mustard, salt, garlic powder, and black pepper in a jar and shake until well combined. Set aside.
3. Place sliced onion, cubed butternut squash, and dried thyme on a sheet pan. Add 2 tablespoons dressing and 1 teaspoon salt. Toss to coat and spread evenly. Roast 20 minutes.
5. After 20 minutes, stir vegetables. Add chicken breasts to the sheet pan. Drizzle with a little dressing, season with salt and pepper, and roast 15-20 minutes, until chicken reaches 160 degrees F and squash is tender. Set aside to cool.
6. Add the kale to a large serving bowl. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and squeeze kale with your hands 5â€“10 times until softened.
7. To the kale add the apple, cranberries (or dates), pecans, and crumbled feta.
8. Chop the cooled chicken into bite-sized pieces. Add to salad along with roasted squash and onions.
9. Add desired amount of dressing and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve.
