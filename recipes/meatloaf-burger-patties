<h1>Meatloaf Burger Patties</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 pound ground beef</li>
<li>1/3 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
<li>1/4 cup milk</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1/4 cup finely grated onion (with juices)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ketchup</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>In a large bowl, mix the panko with the milk and let it soak for 5 minutes. This helps keep the patties extra tender.</li>
<li>Add the egg, grated onion, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the bowl. Stir well.</li>
<li>Gently mix in the ground beef until just combined. Try not to overmix, as that can make the patties tough.</li>
<li>Form into 8 small patties, about 2 inches in diameter.</li>
<li>Cook the patties in a lightly oiled pan over medium heat, about 3-4 minutes per side. Alternatively, bake on a parchment-lined baking sheet at 375Â°F for 15-18 minutes.</li>
<li>Serve on mini slider buns and add your favorite toppings.</li>
