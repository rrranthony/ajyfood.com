<h1>Red Lentil Dill Soup with Mint</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>12 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>8 green onions, chopped (about 1 cup)</li>
<li>1 15-ounce can diced tomatoes</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried mint (or 1/4 cup fresh, chopped)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
<li>8 cups vegetable or chicken broth</li>
<li>2 cups dried red lentils</li>
<li>1 large sweet potato, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
<li>1 cup orange juice</li>
<li>4 teaspoons dried dill (or 1/4 cup fresh, chopped)</li>
<li>12 ounces fresh spinach (about 12 cups loosely packed), chopped</li>
<li>Zest of 1 lemon  </li>
<li>3 tablespoons lemon juice  </li>
<li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  </li>
<li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>In a soup pot, saut√© the garlic and green onions in a little bit of broth (instead of oil) for about 2 minutes, until they begin to wilt.  </li>
<li>Add the can of diced tomatoes (liquid included), mint, and oregano, and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes more.  </li>
<li>Add the broth, lentils, sweet potato, and orange juice, and bring to a boil.  </li>
<li>Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the sweet potato is tender and the lentils are soft but not mushy, about 15 minutes.  </li>
<li>With an immersion blender, blend the soup to the consistency you like, right in the pot. Leave some whole bits of tomato and sweet potato for a slightly chunky texture.  </li>
<li>Stir in the dill, spinach, lemon zest, lemon juice, pepper, and vinegar, and cook for a few minutes more.  </li>
<li>Serve hot with croutons, plain Greek yogurt, or any toppings of choice.</li>
