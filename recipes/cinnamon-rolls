<h1>Cinnamon Rolls</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 t active dry yeast</li>
<li>1/2 C lukewarm water</li>
<li>1 C unsalted butter</li>
<li>2/3 C sugar</li>
<li>1 C whole milk</li>
<li>1 1/2 t salt</li>
<li>2 T vanilla extract</li>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>7 C bread flour</li>
<li>2 T canola oil</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>In a small bowl add the lukewarm water and the active dry yeast.</li>
<li>In a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, cream the butter and sugar together for 7 minutes.</li>
<li>To the creamed butter and sugar add in the yeast and water mixture, whole milk, salt, vanilla extract, eggs, and 5 1/2 C bread flour.</li>
<li>Continue to run the mixture for a few more minutes, adding the remaining bread flour 1/4 C at a time until the dough is thick but not sticky, and forms a ball at the bottom of the mixer. You may not need all 7 cups of flour.</li>
<li>Reduce the speed to low and let the mixer knead the dough for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Use the canola oil to lightly coat a large metal bowl (it should be large enough for the dough to double in size).</li>
<li>Transfer the dough to the oiled bowl, rolling the dough around so the outside of the dough is lightly covered with oil.</li>
<li>Cover the bowl with foil and let the dough rise in a warm, draft free spot for an hour and a half. The dough should nearly double in size.</li>
<li>While you wait, prepare the filling and icing and line a baking sheet with parchment paper and brush with some of the melted butter.</li>
