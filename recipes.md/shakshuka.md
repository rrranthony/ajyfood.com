# Shakshuka

## Ingredients
- 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
- 1 large red bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1 jalapeño, seeded and thinly sliced
- 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 1 1/2 tablespoons smoked paprika
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes, with juices, crushed by hand
- 1/2 cup cilantro and/or parsley
- 6 eggs
- Optional toppings: sliced black olives, feta cheese, artichoke hearts
- Crusty bread, for serving

## Steps
1. Heat a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, red bell pepper, and jalapeño with a few tablespoons of water to prevent sticking. Cook until softened and lightly browned, about 8 to 10 minutes, adding small splashes of water as needed.
2. Add garlic and cook 30 seconds until fragrant.
3. Add paprika and cumin, stirring 30 seconds more.
4. Add tomatoes with their juices and stir to combine. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes, until slightly thickened.
5. Season with salt and pepper, and stir in half the cilantro and/or parsley.
6. Make small wells in the sauce with a spoon and crack an egg into each. Spoon a little sauce around each egg white to help contain it, keeping yolks exposed.
7. Season eggs lightly with salt, cover, and cook over low heat until whites are just set and yolks are still runny, about 5 to 8 minutes.
8. Remove from heat and sprinkle with remaining herbs and any optional toppings. Serve immediately with crusty bread.
