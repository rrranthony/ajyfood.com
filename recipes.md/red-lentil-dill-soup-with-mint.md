# Red Lentil Dill Soup with Mint

## Ingredients
- 12 cloves garlic, minced
- 8 green onions, chopped (about 1 cup)
- 1 15-ounce can diced tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon dried mint (or 1/4 cup fresh, chopped)
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 8 cups vegetable or chicken broth
- 2 cups dried red lentils
- 1 large sweet potato, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1 cup orange juice
- 4 teaspoons dried dill (or 1/4 cup fresh, chopped)
- 12 ounces fresh spinach (about 12 cups loosely packed)
- Zest of 1 lemon  
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice  
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar  

## Steps
1. In a soup pot, saut√© the garlic and green onions in a little bit of broth (instead of oil) for about 2 minutes, until they begin to wilt.  
2. Add the can of diced tomatoes (liquid included), mint, and oregano, and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes more.  
3. Add the broth, lentils, sweet potato, and orange juice, and bring to a boil.  
4. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the sweet potato is tender and the lentils are soft but not mushy, about 15 minutes.  
5. With an immersion blender, blend the soup to the consistency you like, right in the pot. Leave some whole bits of tomato and sweet potato for a slightly chunky texture.  
6. Stir in the dill, spinach, lemon zest, lemon juice, pepper, and vinegar, and cook for a few minutes more.  
7. Serve hot.
