## Ingredients
- 1 pound broccoli
- 1/3 cup dried cranberries

## Steps

2. Peel the tough skin from the broccoli stems, then chop florets into 1/2-inch pieces and stems into 1/4-inch dice.
3. In a bowl, mix soy sauce, maple syrup, and smoked paprika. Add almonds and toss to coat, then spread them onto one baking sheet.
4. Toss pepitas in the same bowl with any remaining seasoning, then spread onto the second baking sheet.
5. Bake both sheets for 10 to 14 minutes, until golden brown. Let cool for 5 minutes to crisp up.
