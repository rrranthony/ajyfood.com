# Lemony Herby Turkey Patties with Cauliflower Mash and Spinach

## Ingredients
### Cauliflower Mash
- 1 medium head cauliflower, cut into florets
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 tablespoons sour cream
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

### Turkey Patties
- 1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves and tender stems
- 1 pound ground turkey
- 1/3 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 large egg
- 2 tablespoons sour cream
- 2 garlic cloves, minced or grated
- Zest of 1 lemon (keep the lemon for the juice)
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

### Spinach
- 1 pound baby spinach
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

## Steps
1. Place cauliflower florets in a food processor and pulse into rice-sized pieces. Transfer to a large microwave-safe bowl with garlic cloves and 1/4 cup water. Cover and microwave on high for 12 minutes. Drain any liquid. (Do not wash the food processor — you will use it again to finish the mash.)
2. Finely chop parsley and place most in a large bowl (reserve some for garnish). Add ground turkey, breadcrumbs, Parmesan, egg, sour cream, garlic, and lemon zest. Mix gently, then form into 4 patties about 1/2 inch thick.
3. Heat olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add patties and cook until golden brown on both sides, 4–5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and cover with foil.
4. Halve the zested lemon. In the same skillet, off heat, add baby spinach, olive oil, and squeeze in juice from half the lemon. Stir just until wilted, 1–2 minutes. Cover to keep warm while finishing the cauliflower.
5. Return cauliflower and garlic to the food processor. Add sour cream, Parmesan, about 2 teaspoons lemon juice (from the remaining lemon), and a few grinds of black pepper. Pulse until smooth or slightly chunky, adding a splash of water or stock if needed to loosen. Adjust seasonings to taste.
6. Serve each turkey patty with a side of cauliflower mash and spinach.
